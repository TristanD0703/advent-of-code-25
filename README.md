# Advent Of Code 2025

These are my answers to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges! Each day of the challenge can be found in its respectively named folder.

This time I wanted to challenge myself by learning a new language: Go! These challenges will hopefully help me feel more confident with the language so that I'm ready to do some bigger projects written in Go 👀

Each day's programs are my solutions to the 2nd challenge for the day.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. [Learn more] (https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. Navigate to the corresponding day's question page and find the question's input text.

3. Create a new file in the respective day's folder called "input.txt", then paste the input text from the website

4. Open a terminal and change directories to the day's folder like `cd ./day-{number}`, then run `go run .`. The last line of output will be the answer to the question.
